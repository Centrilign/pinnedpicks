## What Is PinnedPicks™?

PinnedPicks™ is a curated product discovery platform designed to cut through the noise of modern online shopping. Instead of overwhelming users with cluttered catalogs and endless listings, it focuses on hand-picked, editorial-style collections organized by category — fashion, tech, lifestyle, room décor, beauty, and everyday essentials.

The goal is simple: help people discover products worth exploring, without opening five different apps.

---

## About the Project

PinnedPicks™ started as an independent early-stage web platform with a clear focus — make product discovery feel intentional rather than exhausting.

The platform currently curates products from three affiliate partner ecosystems:

| Platform | Region Focus |
|----------|-------------|
| **Shopee** | Philippines & Southeast Asia |
| **SHEIN** | Global Fashion |
| **Amazon** | Global Essentials & Tech |

Users can browse collections by category, save products locally to their device, and revisit their favorite finds through a dedicated **Saved Pins** experience — no account or login required.

## Philosophy

PinnedPicks™ is built around the idea that product discovery should feel **intentional** — not overwhelming.

> Not another bloated affiliate catalog. A curated discovery experience that helps users quickly find products worth exploring.

Design principles that guide every decision:

- **Visually clean** — editorial over catalog
- **Lightweight** — no unnecessary dependencies
- **Inspiring** — products presented with context, not just specs
- **Practical** — real picks for real people
- **User-focused** — no dark patterns, no spam

---

## Affiliate Disclosure

PinnedPicks™ participates in affiliate programs with Shopee, SHEIN, Amazon, and other selected ecommerce platforms. Some outbound product links may generate a commission when purchases are made through affiliate referrals — **at no additional cost to you**.

All product selections and editorial recommendations are curated independently. Affiliate relationships do not influence which products are featured.

---

## Local Storage Usage

PinnedPicks™ uses `localStorage` for two things only:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Theme preference | Remembers light or dark mode between visits |
| Saved Pins | Persists bookmarked products locally on your device |

This data **never leaves your device** and is not transmitted to any external server. You can clear it at any time through your browser settings.
